DAGYo
=====

DESCRIPTION:
A simple graph implementation (not necessarily a Directed Acyclic Graph). This implementation is a socket-based, parallelizable, primarily Command-Line based tool. Each graph basically consists of a number of nodes and n-ary edges, with a number of optional modules that can be added.

WHY:
This was created for multiple purposes: to provide a simple graph based structure for a multitude of projects, and to form the basis of the OpenCyc reimplementation. This was spurred by the need to reduce memory size, (hopefully) increase inference speed, and improve stability. The reimplementation can be found at https://github.com/Effervex/CycDAG.git
